# GeoIP-X-Lattency_Tracker
This project visualizes the latency and hop count of multiple IP addresses using GeoIP data and network traceroutes. It plots geolocated IPs on an interactive map and analyzes relationships between geographic distance, latency, and traceroute hop counts using correlation and statistical techniques like Pearson correlation and IQR outlier detection.
